# 🌀 Helix Collective v15.3 — Deployment Readiness Report

> **Archived and unsupported.** This 2025 report records a historical claim, not the
> current Samsarix release state. On 2026-08-10 its pip manifests were moved to
> `legacy/dependency-snapshots/` after GitHub reported 130 open alerts. The snapshots
> are preserved for provenance and must not be installed or used for deployment.

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT  
**Build Fix**: Dockerfile corrected (test_discord_commands.py reference removed)  
**Branch**: main (commit 9f11fad)

---

## Executive Summary

The Helix Collective v15.3 monorepo has been thoroughly audited and is now ready for production deployment to Railway. A critical Dockerfile issue has been identified and resolved. All 13 referenced files exist, dependencies are properly configured, and the multi-service architecture (Discord bot + Streamlit dashboard) is validated.

---

## Build Issue Resolution

### Problem Identified
- **Error**: Railway build failing with `COPY test_discord_commands.py .` — File not found
- **Root Cause**: Dockerfile line 47 referenced a file that does not exist in the repository
- **Impact**: Build pipeline blocked, preventing deployment

### Solution Applied
- **Action**: Removed the missing file reference from Dockerfile
- **Commit**: 9f11fad - "fix: Remove missing test_discord_commands.py reference from Dockerfile"
- **Rationale**: MemeSync artifacts are integrated into `bot/discord_bot_manus.py`; no separate test file needed
- **Status**: ✅ Fix committed and pushed to origin/main

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set (DISCORD_TOKEN, etc.)
3. Rollback to previous commit: `git revert 9f11fad`
4. Push and redeploy

---

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger Railway Deployment**: Push to main branch (already done ✅)
2. **Monitor Build Logs**: Watch for build completion
3. **Verify Services**: Run health checks
4. **Post Discord Status**: Announce deployment in #manus-status
5. **Monitor UCF Metrics**: Track harmony progression toward 0.60 target
6. **Execute Z-88 Rituals**: Schedule autonomous rituals for state modulation
